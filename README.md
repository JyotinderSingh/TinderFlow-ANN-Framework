# TinderFlow - A very (very) simple ANN Framework
## I built this toy framework as a small side project to brush up on my knowledge about Neural Networks by implementing some of the most integral components of a Neural Network using only Python and NumPy.

## *Features*
- Fully connected Layers
- ReLU, Softmax activations
- Generate random test data
- Categorical Cross Entropy Loss
- Backpropogation

The name is just a joke that I made by combining the second half of my name (Jyotinder) with TensorFlow.
